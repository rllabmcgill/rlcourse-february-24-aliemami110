In this project, our intented object is to experiment with β-model for a mixture time-scale model prediction. While we were reading the paper "TD Models: Modelling the world with a Mixture of Time Scales", we started to experiment with
TD(λ) models and found it is very interesting. In this assignment, we present the work of using TD(λ) to do policy evaluation for one-step models of wall-following and random walks. We will investigate the performance of TD(
λ) and Dyna on β-models in the next assignment.
